# OPTION 2:

## Introduction to NodeJS

## Installation
- Install [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)

## JavaScript Runtime
- Node operates on the V8 Google Chrome JavaScript runtime.
- This runtime is what is responsible for interpreting the JavaScript and mapping it over to machine commands.
- Commands are executed through an architecture known as the "call stack." Currently-processing requests are part of the call stack, and come from the process queue.

## What is Node?
- Node JS is an interface that allows you to write server-side code in JavaScript.
- This interface provides the ability to handle requests and issue responses.
- It is asynchronous, and as a result, can be written in a way that will not block the call stack.
- Node is also a server that will allow your code to be accessible to the public and be able to issue responses for certain requests.
