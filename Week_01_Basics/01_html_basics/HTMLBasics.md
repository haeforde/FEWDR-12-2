## Introduce HTML(20 min)

#### What is HTML

* HTML is what we refer to as a markup language and is the standard we use for creating web pages and web applications.
* Created by Tim Berners Lee, it forms the skeleton of the internet.
* What does HTML stand for?

#### HTML Elements and Tags

* If HTML is the skeleton than HTML elements are the individual bones. And just like bones each element serves a different purpose.
* To distinguish one element from another we use "Tags"

#### This is a motherf****** website

There are over 250 tags so instead of going over every one of them piece by piece let's look at a site to try to get an understanding of what these tags DO!

Let's visit http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/

**First lets try to recognize what is being represented on the page itself:**
  *Ask questions like "What does this text represent?" or "What category might you group this text in?"
